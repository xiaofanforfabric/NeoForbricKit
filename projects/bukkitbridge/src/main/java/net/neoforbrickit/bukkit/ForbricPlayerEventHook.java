/**
 * Raises {@code PlayerJoinEvent} and {@code PlayerQuitEvent} from the game's own join/leave path.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> A Bukkit plugin's most basic hook is "a player arrived" — welcome
 * messages, permissions, per-player state, and in this repository's own test case, a verification
 * code sent to chat. None of it runs unless something turns the game's join into an event, and
 * nothing in NeoForge knows that an {@code org.bukkit.event.player.PlayerJoinEvent} is supposed to
 * exist. Before this class the bridge dispatched exactly three event types (two interact paths and
 * the channel registration), so a plugin could be loaded, enabled, and have every listener it
 * registered never fire once.
 *
 * <p><b>Called from the game, not from the bridge.</b> The call sites are injected into
 * {@code ServerGamePacketListenerImpl.handleAcceptPlayerLoad} and {@code PlayerList.remove} by
 * {@code net.neoforbrickit.bridge.transform.BukkitPlayerEventInjector}, which is why these are
 * static entry points taking the player rather than methods on a bridge object: the injected
 * bytecode has to reach them with nothing but what the target method already has.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here may throw.</b> These run inside the game's own join and leave handling. An
 * exception on the way in would be attributed to the connection and could disconnect the player
 * before they ever spawn; an exception on the way out would leave the player list half-updated.
 * A plugin that throws in its listener is reported and skipped — see
 * {@code ForbricPluginManager#callEvent}, which already contains plugin failures.
 *
 * <h2>Why the join hook is {@code handleAcceptPlayerLoad} and not {@code placeNewPlayer}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code PlayerList.placeNewPlayer} runs while the player is still moving through the
 * configuration-to-play handshake: the client has not yet reported that it finished loading the
 * terrain. A message sent at that point can arrive before the client's chat window exists, which
 * is indistinguishable from "the plugin did nothing". {@code handleAcceptPlayerLoad} is the packet
 * that says the client is ready, and it is where the reference server raises the same event.

	 * A player is about to be placed into the world: raise {@code AsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent}.

	 *
	 * <p>It is where a permission plugin loads a player's data. LuckPerms registers
	 * {@code onPlayerPreLogin} for it and does nothing at join time but read what that handler stored — so
	 * without this event its user manager never learns the player exists, {@code /lp user <name>} answers
	 * "user not found" for somebody standing in the world, and every permission check falls back to the
	 * declared defaults. That is exactly the state this bridge was in: the plugin enabled, the commands ran,
	 * and no player was ever known to it.
	 *
	 * <p>Raised here rather than at the network handshake because this is the earliest point the bridge has
	 * a {@code ServerPlayer} to describe: an {@code AsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent} needs a name, an address and a
	 * UUID, and all three are on the player the game has already authenticated. The event is documented as
	 * asynchronous, and it is — a handler may block on a database read — but raising it from the game thread
	 * is what a single-threaded bridge can honestly do; a handler that needs to block still can, and the cost
	 * is one login's worth of latency rather than a wrong answer for the whole session.
	 *
	 * <p>Because it is the event plugins DISALLOW logins with, the result is honoured: a handler that calls
	 * {@code disallow} disconnects the player with the handler's own message, which is the behaviour a whitelist
	 * or ban plugin relies on. The connection to close is taken as an ARGUMENT — see the note in the body about
	 * why asking the player for it cannot work at this point in the login.
